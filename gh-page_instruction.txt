Now that youâ€™ve completed this project, you should make it available online so you can share your progress with others! One way to do this is by using GitHub Pages.

To deploy your /src directory to GitHub Pages, be sure to commit all of your changes and make a new branch called gh-pages. Once you are checked into the gh-pages branch, run the following command:

git subtree push --prefix src origin gh-pages
This will push the src folder up to GitHub on the gh-pages branch. After that, you should be able to open up http://username.github.io/jQueryBadgesProject, where username is your GitHub username.
